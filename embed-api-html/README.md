# Embed API

## Overview

Contains hard wired (in terms of codes and non-expiring keys) examples of both siteplans and floorplans.  

Renderings are interactive plan viewers, each in an `iframe` HTML element.  
This example illustrates the way that you can embed interactive floorplan viewers in your applications with minimal effort.

## Prerequisites

- Download the HTML file!

## Quick Start

- Download the HTML file.
- Open the file in a modern browser.
- As each embedded viewer needs to render a floorplan, it may take several seconds before all are present.

- `panning` - [mouse-click-down] + [mouse-move] 
- `zoom` - mouse wheel
- `mini-map` displayed when you are zoomed in and the plan is clipped to your screen limits
- `metadata` - right click on icons to see additional information entered information
